# MaKore
## Best Way to Communicate

MaKore is a communication app we build during the semester<br />
This is the second part - Web Server.<br />
In addition to the previous part, we used and experienced with: ASP.net and C#, signalR, MVC design pattern, MySQL database, JSON Web Token (JWT) and services.<br />

### About the Server
Our website's server has to be connected in order to be able to use MaKore. <br />
The server holds a database with all of MaKore's users, chats information, and messages. <br />
It supports HTTP's GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and returns or updates the relevant information. <br />
Besides responding to our clients, the server can also receive requests from other servers. This way, MaKore's users can chat with other users from different websites that also implement the same API as our server. <br />

Our very first encounter with MVC was the **rating page**.<br />
You can add a review, edit and delete an existing review, and also go back to the chat if you are a connected user.<br />
<br />

<br />
Notice that there is a "Return to Chat" button. Going back to the chat will only be possible when a user has logged in and pressed the rating button in the chat (see an explenation below). Since we use JWT, when this user wants to go back to the chat he will be redirected to the login page if the time session has already passed. <br />

### About the MaKore Website
Since we already talked about the chat in the first assigment, here we only present improvements and new concepts. <br />

#### Sign Up page:
Now, our users are no longer hard coded. A new user can register, and his details are passed to the server that keeps them in his DB. <br />
<br />
![signup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/164452688-3818a90f-e764-47b8-99f7-fed8fe7ff71c.jpg)<br />
<br />

#### Sign In page:
An existing user that has registered appears in the DB. Thus he can log in and the server will be incharge of his validation.<br />
Of course the server has to be connected for this. Thus, if the server is offline (or if something happend) we let the user know. <br />
<br />
![serverError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170189297-47eb1116-86d3-479c-aea2-ce5e2307944d.jpg)<br />
<br />
Besides that, the autantication we do in order to validate the user stays the same, with the exception that now it's done by the sevrer.

#### Chat page:
That's where the big improvements are.<br />

First, we added a button connecting the chat to the **rating page**: <br />
<br />
![ratingSym](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170192840-7acf343a-757b-45cd-83f0-5b795979fdf3.jpg)
<br />

Now let's take a look at corali which has no conversations yet. <br />
In order to **add a new chat**, the user has to know the contact's server. This way the user's client-side will know who to pass the invitation to. <br />
<br />
![addContact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170191209-5e036d7e-2529-4fdb-a9ae-74f5917235ef.jpg)<br />
<br />
![specificContatc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170191745-657a90e1-00cd-4bbb-9441-19e633582783.jpg) <br />
<br />
When trying to add another server's user, we let the user know it may take awhile due to the communication with another server. <br />
 <br />
![diffServer1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170193752-68d1d666-63b5-4aad-8990-ae9faa3d7147.jpg)<br />
<br />
When an error has occured (for example if the other server is not availabe at the moment) we also tell the user. <br />
 <br />
![diffServer2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170193909-701c7510-eccc-4ec2-a7e8-0bde1287b0cd.jpg)<br />
<br />
And if we could reach the other server, we tell the user the invitation was succesfully sent. <br />
<br />
![invitation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170194735-c13f4192-a427-4536-ad72-c0a8d731214e.jpg)<br />

Since we support **online communication** (using signalR), the message corali wrote to tal appeared at tal's website right away in a new chat between them:<br />
<br />
![realTimeMess](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90967892/170192114-3ea920d0-f990-42f2-a57b-d43186e7ac16.jpg) <br />
<br />


#### Notes:
- We only support text messages now.
- Searching users in the chat is still available. The search is case-sensitive.
- All the requirments of signing up to MaKore stay the same.
- There is one picture (of MaKore) for all users.
- We assume that "bearer JWT" and "@microsoft/signalR" packages are already installed on your PC.
- Please make sure the server is running on "localhost:5018" and the client is running on "localhost:3000".
- **Please do not store or send important information like real passwords or important text on the server because this application does not take into consideration many considerations that must be taken in the context of the security of the application.**

### How to Run
Our project divides into two servers, and thus two repositories. <br />
The first repository is MaKore - the first assigment. There we branched to "ex2" and left "master" intact for those who check our first assigment. (A link to that repository is also in details.txt). <br />
As in for this repository, here is the server. You need to run it first in order to test our chat itself. Also, the homepage (localhost) of the server is the rating page, although you can easily get there using the button on the chat itself (as explained before). <br />
<br />
1. Clone this repository - the server:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/CoralKuta/MaKoreChat
    ```
2. Enter the MaKore folder and open the project:
    ```
    cd MaKoreChat/MaKore.sln
    ```
3. Open the Package Manager Console and update the database (that you already cloned)
    ```
    update-database
    ```
4. run the server code (from the MaKore.sln)
    ```
    Ctrl+F5
    ```
5. Clone the Client repository:
    ```
    git clone -b ex2 https://github.com/CoralKuta/MaKore
    ```
6. Enter the MaKore client folder:
    ```
    cd MaKore
    ```
7. Install all modules:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
8. Run the program:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
9. Sign up and Explore!
